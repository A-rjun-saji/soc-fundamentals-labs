# Networking SOC Labs

This folder contains hands-on SOC labs covering networking fundamentals
from a security operations perspective.

## Labs Covered
- TCP/IP 3-way handshake (packet-level proof)
- Ports and protocols behavior
- Normal vs abnormal listening ports
- Port scanning detection (Defender firewall logs)
- Trusted port abuse (443 ≠ HTTPS)

## Focus
These labs emphasize how SOC analysts:
- Validate activity using packets and logs
- Distinguish normal vs suspicious behavior
- Identify attacker reconnaissance techniques
